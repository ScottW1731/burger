unless the burger has been eaten I have to place this code
                {{> burgers/burgers-block complete=false}} line21
file is index.handlebars



first make sure in main.handlebars calling CSS and JS in public folder
see armando's code 

second inside of public/assets/js/public.js see how to make a post and put request
using ajax through events button on click

third search for partials.handlebars and how I can use it to update this partials
of my frontend if everything is clear I can place the notes I put from line 30-36 in handlebars
